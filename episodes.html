		<p><u>Episode 1: Pilot</u></p>
		<p>Rick takes Morty on a trip to another dimension to find seeds to "mega-trees," while Jerry and Beth argue over Rick's influence over their son. Rick establishes himself as a bad influence on his grandson when it is discovered that Morty has missed a semester of school in the time he's spent on adventures with Rick. Rick takes Morty to another dimension, known as Dimension 35-C, which has the perfect conditions for growing "Mega Trees", which Rick requires for his research. Ultimately, the seeds are used to briefly make Morty highly intelligent, causing his parents to believe he is fine with his education and let Rick stay. </p>

Rick and Morty reunite with Jerry as they attempt to find a real escape pod to use. They climb into one but are promptly pursued by Zigerion ships. Rick orders Morty to mix 2 parts cesium, 1 part plutonic quartz, and an entire (12ox/355mL) bottled water to create concentrated dark matter. But then, Morty freezes and the ship fades away, proving that it was just Rick and Jerry in the simulation all along.</p>
