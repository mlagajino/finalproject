	<div class="rick">
		<img src="rick.jpg" width="200">
    	<p><u>Rick Sanchez</u></p>
    	<p>Rick Sanchez is the co-main character and leading protagonist of the show. He is a genius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are a source of concern for his daughter's family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty.</p>
    </div>
  		
	<div class="morty">
		<img src="morty.jpg" width="200">
		<p><u>Morty Smith</u></p>
		<p>Morty Smith is the co-main protagonists in Rick and Morty. Rick's good-hearted but easily distressed 14-year-old grandson is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox methods Rick uses to 'fix' situations. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="summer">
		<img src="summer.jpg" width="200">
		<p><u>Summer Smith</u></p>
		<p>Summer Smith is Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to her mother, as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking. She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="beth">
		<img src="beth.jpg" width="200">
		<p><u>Beth Smith</u></p>
		<p>Beth Smith is Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife. She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to actual, human medicine. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her husband's ego, which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief that she has "settled" in her marriage, family, and job.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="jerry">
		<img src="jerry.jpg" width="200">
		<p><u>Jerry Smith</u></p>
		<p>Morty's insecure father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick. Beth views Jerry as meek under his boasts, ultimately fearful of confrontation.</p>
