		<p>The show revolves around the adventures of Rick Sanchez, an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, and Morty Smith, Rick's 14-year-old grandson, a kind but easily distressed boy, whose naive but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Other characters involve the rest of the Smith family, Summer Smith, Morty's 17-year-old sister, a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures; Beth Smith, Rick's daughter, a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, who is dissatisfied with her marriage; Jerry Smith, Beth's husband, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.</p>
